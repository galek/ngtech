/*
 * This program is intended to help you determine how to configure the JPEG
 * software for installation on a particular system.  The idea is to try to
 * compile and execute this program.  If your compiler fails to compile the
 * program, make changes as indicated in the comments below.  Once you can
 * compile the program, run it, and it will produce a "jconfig.h" file for
 * your system.
 *
 * As a general rule, each time you try to compile this program,
 * pay attention only to the *first* error message you get from the compiler.
 * Many C compilers will issue lots of spurious error messages once they
 * have gotten confused.  Go to the line indicated in the first error message,
 * and read the comments preceding that line to see what to change.
 *
 * Almost all of the edits you may need to make to this program consist of
 * changing a line that reads "#define SOME_SYMBOL" to "#undef SOME_SYMBOL",
 * or vice versa.  This is called defining or undefining that symbol.
 */

 * We start out with the assumption that your system has all the ANSI-standard
 * include files.  If you get any error trying to include one of these files,
